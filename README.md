Bidimensional DFT made for First Assignment of Surface and volumetric data rendering visualization class

This is just a simple code in C language for the computation of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a two-dimensional signal, by using pthreads multithreading.

The program compute the dft of the bidimensional signal passed as input at the program and perform the square distant with each dft in the database(directory of precomputed dft)
